[2026-01-20] Completed: Fix UI offset caused by agent output stream on iteration completion
- Modified AgentOutput component to return null when there's no content to display
- Changed from always rendering a Box with padding to conditionally rendering only when there's actual content
- Updated orchestrator to call agentStore.reset() on iteration completion instead of just clearOutput()
- This ensures clean agent state between iterations and prevents empty boxes from causing layout shifts
