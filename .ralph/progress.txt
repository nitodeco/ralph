Task 1: Add retry logic and error recovery for agent failures - COMPLETED

Implementation:
- Added maxRetries and retryDelayMs to RalphConfig type in src/types.ts
- Implemented exponential backoff retry logic in useAgent hook with calculateRetryDelay function
- Added error categorization with FATAL_ERROR_PATTERNS to determine retryable vs fatal errors
- Updated RunApp to pass retryCount and isRetrying props to AgentOutput
- Added configuration options in SetupWizard for max_retries and retry_delay steps
- Display retry configuration in setup completion summary

Task 2: Implement session persistence and resume capability - COMPLETED

Implementation:
- Session types (Session, SessionStatus) already existed in src/types.ts with iteration count, start time, current task index
- Core session functions (loadSession, saveSession, deleteSession, createSession, updateSessionIteration, updateSessionStatus, isSessionResumable) already existed in lib/session.ts
- Auto-save on iteration completion was already implemented in RunApp's onIterationComplete callback
- Added resume prompt UI in RunApp showing session info when a resumable session is detected
- Added /resume slash command handler in RunApp to resume interrupted sessions
- Added autoResume prop to RunApp to support automatic resume from CLI
- Added "ralph resume" CLI command to index.tsx that auto-resumes existing sessions
- Updated HelpView with /resume command and resume CLI command documentation
- Updated printHelp() with resume command documentation

Task 3: Add comprehensive logging system - COMPLETED

Implementation:
- Created src/lib/logger.ts with Logger class supporting log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- Implemented log rotation with configurable max file size (default 5MB) and backup count (default 3)
- Added logFilePath configuration option to RalphConfig in src/types.ts
- Logs are written to .ralph/ralph.log by default
- Integrated logging in useAgent hook for agent executions, outputs, exit codes, errors, and retries
- Integrated logging in RunApp for iteration starts, completions, session starts, resumes, and max iterations
- Each log entry includes ISO timestamp, log level, message, and optional context
- Added helper functions: getLogger, createLogger, readLogFile, getRecentLogEntries

Task 4: Implement agent timeout and watchdog functionality - COMPLETED

Implementation:
- Added agentTimeoutMs and stuckThresholdMs configuration options to RalphConfig in src/types.ts
- Default timeout is 30 minutes (DEFAULT_AGENT_TIMEOUT_MS = 30 * 60 * 1000)
- Default stuck threshold is 5 minutes (DEFAULT_STUCK_THRESHOLD_MS = 5 * 60 * 1000)
- Implemented timeout wrapper in useAgent that kills agent process if it exceeds agentTimeoutMs
- Added heartbeat detection that monitors stdout/stderr activity
- Agent is killed and retried if no output for stuckThresholdMs duration
- Stuck check runs at intervals of min(stuckThresholdMs/4, 30 seconds)
- Both timeout and stuck errors are treated as retryable errors
- Setting timeout or stuck threshold to 0 disables that feature
- Added SetupWizard steps for configuring agent timeout and stuck threshold
- Display timeout and stuck threshold settings in setup completion summary

Task 5: Add notification system for completion and failures - COMPLETED

Implementation:
- Added NotificationConfig interface with systemNotification, webhookUrl, and markerFilePath options in src/types.ts
- Added NotificationEvent type for 'complete', 'max_iterations', and 'fatal_error' events
- Created src/lib/notifications.ts with notification functions:
  - sendSystemNotification: Uses osascript to send macOS system notifications
  - sendWebhookNotification: Sends HTTP POST request with JSON payload to configured webhook URL
  - writeMarkerFile: Writes JSON marker file with event details for script integration
  - sendNotifications: Orchestrates all configured notification methods
- Added notification configuration steps to SetupWizard:
  - System notification enable/disable option
  - Webhook URL text input (optional)
  - Marker file path text input (optional)
  - Display notification settings in setup completion summary
- Integrated notifications into RunApp:
  - Send 'complete' notification when all tasks are finished
  - Send 'max_iterations' notification when iteration limit is reached
  - Send 'fatal_error' notification when an unrecoverable error occurs

Task 6: Implement background/daemon mode - COMPLETED

Implementation:
- Created src/lib/daemon.ts with daemon management functions:
  - writePidFile: Writes process ID to .ralph/ralph.pid
  - readPidFile: Reads PID from file
  - deletePidFile: Removes PID file
  - isProcessRunning: Checks if process with given PID is running
  - isBackgroundProcessRunning: Checks if Ralph daemon is currently running
  - spawnDaemonProcess: Spawns detached child process with output redirected to log file
  - isDaemonProcess: Checks if current process is a daemon child
  - cleanupDaemon: Cleans up PID file on exit
- Updated src/index.tsx:
  - Added --background and -b flags to CLI argument parser
  - Added handleBackgroundMode function to spawn daemon and display status
  - Added signal handlers (SIGTERM, SIGINT) for graceful daemon shutdown
  - Daemon child writes own PID and cleans up on exit
  - Added autoStart prop to RunWithSetup for daemon auto-start
- Updated src/components/RunApp.tsx:
  - Added autoStart prop to automatically begin iterations in daemon mode
  - Added useEffect to trigger auto-start when running as daemon
- Updated help text with background mode documentation and examples

Task 7: Add 'ralph status' command - COMPLETED

Implementation:
- Added "status" to the Command type in src/index.tsx
- Created printStatus function that displays:
  - Process status (running with PID or not running)
  - Session information (status, start time, last update, elapsed time, iteration count)
  - Project progress (project name, tasks completed, percentage, current/next task)
  - Recent log entries (last 10 entries from ralph.log)
- Added formatElapsedTime helper function for human-readable time display
- Handles case where no session exists gracefully
- Handles case where session was interrupted (not running but status is "running")
- Added "status" command case to CLI switch statement
- Updated help text with status command documentation and examples
