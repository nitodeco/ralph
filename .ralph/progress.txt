Implementation:
- Config validation schema already existed in src/lib/config.ts with comprehensive validation rules

  - prdFormat: Optional, must be "json" or "yaml"
  - maxRetries: Optional, must be non-negative integer
  - retryDelayMs: Optional, must be positive integer
  - agentTimeoutMs: Optional, must be non-negative integer (0 = disabled)
  - stuckThresholdMs: Optional, must be non-negative integer (0 = disabled)
  - notifications: Validates nested systemNotification (boolean), webhookUrl (valid URL), markerFilePath (string)
  - memory: Validates nested maxOutputBufferBytes, memoryWarningThresholdMb, enableGarbageCollectionHints
- Added warnings for potentially problematic configurations:
  - stuckThresholdMs >= agentTimeoutMs (stuck detection will never trigger)
  - maxRetries > 10 (long recovery times)
  - retryDelayMs < 1000 (rapid retries)
  - agentTimeoutMs < 60000 (may timeout before completing tasks)
- Added formatValidationErrors function for clear, actionable error messages
- Added CONFIG_DEFAULTS with complete defaults for all optional fields

- Updated SetupWizard.tsx to import memory defaults from config.ts instead of memory.ts

Bug Fix:
- Fixed critical argument parsing bug in parseArgs function (src/index.tsx)
- The filter condition `argIndex !== taskIndex + 1` was filtering out the first argument when taskIndex was -1
- When taskIndex is -1 (no --task flag), taskIndex + 1 equals 0, causing the first argument to always be filtered out
- Changed to `(taskIndex === -1 || argIndex !== taskIndex + 1)` to only filter the task value when --task flag is present
- This bug was preventing all CLI commands (status, list, config, help, etc.) from working correctly
