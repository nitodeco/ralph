Task 1: Add retry logic and error recovery for agent failures - COMPLETED

Implementation:
- Added maxRetries and retryDelayMs to RalphConfig type in src/types.ts
- Implemented exponential backoff retry logic in useAgent hook with calculateRetryDelay function
- Added error categorization with FATAL_ERROR_PATTERNS to determine retryable vs fatal errors
- Updated RunApp to pass retryCount and isRetrying props to AgentOutput
- Added configuration options in SetupWizard for max_retries and retry_delay steps
- Display retry configuration in setup completion summary

Task 2: Implement session persistence and resume capability - COMPLETED

Implementation:
- Session types (Session, SessionStatus) already existed in src/types.ts with iteration count, start time, current task index
- Core session functions (loadSession, saveSession, deleteSession, createSession, updateSessionIteration, updateSessionStatus, isSessionResumable) already existed in lib/session.ts
- Auto-save on iteration completion was already implemented in RunApp's onIterationComplete callback
- Added resume prompt UI in RunApp showing session info when a resumable session is detected
- Added /resume slash command handler in RunApp to resume interrupted sessions
- Added autoResume prop to RunApp to support automatic resume from CLI
- Added "ralph resume" CLI command to index.tsx that auto-resumes existing sessions
- Updated HelpView with /resume command and resume CLI command documentation
- Updated printHelp() with resume command documentation

Task 3: Add comprehensive logging system - COMPLETED

Implementation:
- Created src/lib/logger.ts with Logger class supporting log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- Implemented log rotation with configurable max file size (default 5MB) and backup count (default 3)
- Added logFilePath configuration option to RalphConfig in src/types.ts
- Logs are written to .ralph/ralph.log by default
- Integrated logging in useAgent hook for agent executions, outputs, exit codes, errors, and retries
- Integrated logging in RunApp for iteration starts, completions, session starts, resumes, and max iterations
- Each log entry includes ISO timestamp, log level, message, and optional context
- Added helper functions: getLogger, createLogger, readLogFile, getRecentLogEntries
