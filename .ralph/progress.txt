# Progress

## Completed Tasks
- Wire up /tasks command and view routing: Added 'tasks' to ActiveView type, SlashCommand type, VALID_COMMANDS array, handled the command in useSlashCommands.ts to set active view, and added TasksView routing in ViewRouter.tsx. The /tasks command now opens the TasksView component.
- Add toggle done functionality to TasksView: Implemented 'd' key handler in TasksView that calls toggleTaskDone from prd.ts, saves the updated PRD, refreshes the local state, and displays a success message. Users can now mark tasks as done or undone directly from the TasksView using the 'd' key.
- Add delete task functionality with confirmation: Added a ViewMode type with 'list' and 'confirm-delete' modes to TasksView. Users can press 'x' to enter delete confirmation mode, which shows a red-bordered prompt with the task title and options to confirm (Enter) or cancel (Escape). After deletion, the selected index is adjusted to stay within bounds. The help text was updated to show the new 'x Delete' keyboard shortcut.
