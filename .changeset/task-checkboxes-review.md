Add task checkboxes in plan review phase for selective acceptance

- Tasks can now be individually toggled with Space key during review
- New/modified/unchanged tasks are checked by default
- Removed tasks are unchecked by default (must be checked to confirm removal)
- Visual checkboxes (✓/○) show acceptance state for each task
