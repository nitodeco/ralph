feat: add /usage command to terminal UI

Added new /usage slash command that opens an interactive view displaying:
- Summary tab with lifetime statistics (sessions, iterations, tasks, success rate, streaks)
- Sessions tab showing recent session history with status indicators  
- Daily tab showing aggregated daily usage metrics

The view uses tab navigation with arrow keys and matches the existing UI patterns.
