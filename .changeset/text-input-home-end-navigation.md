feat: add Home/End key navigation for line start/end in TextInput

The TextInput component now supports Home and End key navigation for moving the cursor to the start or end of the current line in multiline text:

- Home key moves the cursor to the beginning of the current line
- End key moves the cursor to the end of the current line

This complements the existing up/down arrow line navigation for a more complete multiline editing experience.
