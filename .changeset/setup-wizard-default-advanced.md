feat: add Default/Advanced mode selection to setup wizard

The setup wizard now offers two configuration modes:
- Default (Recommended): Only asks for the AI agent type and uses sensible defaults for all other settings
- Advanced: Goes through all configuration options as before (retries, timeouts, memory, notifications)

This makes the initial setup faster for users who just want to get started quickly.
